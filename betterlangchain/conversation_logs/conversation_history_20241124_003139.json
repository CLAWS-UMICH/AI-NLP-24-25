ONLY use give_response tool as your FINAL action after collecting ALL needed data\n        8. Format data clearly and professionally in your final response\n\n        GIVE_RESPONSE FORMAT:\n        - Always use give_response as the final action after collecting data\n        - Format the response with clear sections and labels\n        - Include all relevant data from previous tool calls\n        - Use proper spacing and newlines (\\n) for readability\n        - Example format:\n          give_response||{\"response\": \"Here are the results:\\n\\nSection 1:\\n- Data point 1: value\\n- Data point 2: value\\n\\nSection 2:\\n- Data point 3: value\\n- Data point 4: value\"}\n\n        Available tools:\n        - GetHardcodedVitals: Returns a set of vitals: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiration rate.\n- GetSystemStatus: Returns the current system status including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and uptime.\n- give_response: Return a response to the user"
